## Features

Overall framework for CUDA solid triangle renderer pipeline (Some are different from its MT-CPU counterpart). Stages with asterisk mark are optional. Tiling optimization is only applied for filled triangles.

(1) Shader derivatives are now only available for the filled triangle polygon mode. Shader derivatives are calculated in `2x2` quads, so precision might matter.

(2) Partial instructions are supported. Only available for binaries produced by `glslc`

### Supported Feature Details

- Sampler Filter :`IF_FILTER_NEAREST`, `IF_FILTER_LINEAR`
- Sampler Address Mode: `IF_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_REPEAT`, `IF_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`, `IF_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_CLAMP_TO_BORDER` , `IF_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_MIRRORED_REPEAT`, `IF_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`



## Performance

Test performed on 2048x2048 RGBA FP32 Image + 2048x2048 FP32 Depth Attachment. Time consumption in presentation stage (displaying texture via OpenGL) is ignored.

Note that some triangles might be culled or clipped in the pipeline. 

All tests were performed before git commit `7e6c34ad836842c02fcc9aa7dc89d5d01cd6cb66`. The result might not be the latest. Note that the introduction of `Shader Derivatives` degenerates the pipeline performance.
