(1) Shader derivatives are now only available for the filled triangle polygon mode. Shader derivatives are calculated in `2x2` quads, so precision might matter.

(2) Partial instructions are supported. Only available for binaries produced by `glslc` or `dxc`

### Supported Feature Details

- Sampler Filter :`IF_FILTER_NEAREST`, `IF_FILTER_LINEAR`
- Sampler Address Mode: `IF_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_REPEAT`, `IF_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`, `IF_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_CLAMP_TO_BORDER` , `IF_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_MIRRORED_REPEAT`, `IF_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`



## Performance

### Frame Rate Comparison (FPS)  Version 2

#### Influence of Attachment Size

Tests performed on multi-thread CPU renderer (1 master + 16 workers), with just-in-time(JIT) compilation of Vulkan-specific HLSL shaders (compiled in SPIR-V binary format). All attachments are in `linear` tiling mode and `float32` mode.

#### Influence of Triangle Numbers

Tests performed on 2048x2048 RGBA FP32 Image + 2048x2048 FP32 Depth Attachment. Time consumption in presentation stage (displaying texture via OpenGL) is ignored. Note that some triangles **might be culled or clipped** in the pipeline.

※ **C++ Class**: shaders are coded and compiled ahead-of-time, using virtual inheritance.

※ **SPIR-V HLSL (C++)**: all shader codes are compiled into binary form using `glslc`. HLSL source codes are written in `Vulkan-specific` style. Just-in-time (JIT) compilation uses LLVM 10 as backend and manual IR mapping (Shared library is compiled with `mingw-w64`). App runs in `msvc`.

※ **SPIR-V HLSL (C#)**: the same as above, but with .NET `P/Invoke Source Generation`(`LibraryImport`) that invokes shared library compiled using C++.
